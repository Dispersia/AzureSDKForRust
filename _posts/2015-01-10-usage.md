# Usage

Usage is very simple with Cargo. For example, in order to connect to Azure blob storage, just put this line in your `Cargo.toml` and you are ready to go:

```rust
azure_sdk_storage_blob = "0.30.0"
```
For starters, this is how you retrieve the contents of a blob:

{% highlight rust linenos=table %}
let client = client::with_access_key("your_storage_account", "your_master_key")?;

let response = client
    .get_blob()
    .with_container_name("mycontainer")
    .with_blob_name("myblob.txt")
    .finalize()
    .await?;

let s_content = String::from_utf8(response.data)?;

println!("myblob.txt contents are == {}", s_content);
{% endhighlight %}

You will find lots of examples in the [blob storage](https://github.com/MindFlavor/AzureSDKForRust/tree/master/azure_sdk_storage_blob/examples), [service bus](https://github.com/MindFlavor/AzureSDKForRust/tree/master/azure_sdk_service_bus/examples) and [Cosmos DB](https://github.com/MindFlavor/AzureSDKForRust/tree/master/azure_sdk_cosmos/examples) example folders. If you find that something is missing/obscure please open an issue and I will happily expand the example section.
